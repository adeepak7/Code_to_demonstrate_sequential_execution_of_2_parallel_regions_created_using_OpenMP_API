# Code to demonstrate sequential execution of 2 parallel regions created using OpenMP API

The **sequential_execution_of_parallel_regions_openmp.cpp** file contains a simple C++ code to prove that the 2 parallel regions defined one after the other execute in the sequential order. 

This also demonstrates that the **printf()** function is atomic in nature.
